0;you have two great running backs why are you qb sneaking breece just ran for 9 yards
1;all i think about is sauce should have had a pick 6
2;that is 100 on sauce
3;this lost is not even on zach we are just ass
4;front office probably lucked out with that rodgers injury to provide rodgers with that o line would have gotten people fired but now they can just blame this season on the injury and zach like last year rodgers would have got murdered today
5;sauce and reed have not played as advertised so far really hope they start to clean it up
6;the team let zach down today
7;sauce is not having a good start to the season
8;hard to see what we have in zach with a trash oline
9;zach please stunt on these hoes
10;dallas with a great drive literally bailed out by the refs multiple times seriously romo just go work for the cowboys and spare us
11;believe it or not it is hard to play when you are pressured on 60 of your snaps
12;we are winning if sauce catches that pass or if the cowboys were not getting every call
13;i like how zac wilson said watch 11 and then immediately gets sacked by 11 they should have listened to him
14;i think jd has done great things but my god how do you not get an oline for this team
15;zach may be inconsistent but he has a cannon and can make big throws at times just let it fly and hope he hits a couple we are not winning with this nonsense
16;wtf do you all expect zach to do when parsons is in his face within 15 seconds on every snap
17;roughing the passer gives the nfl the ability to straight up rig any game
18;so the jets are not allowed to tackle dak got it
19;zach’s qbr is 1162 considering this oline that is amazing really
20;aaron rodgers is apparently a better qb coach than anyone we have ever had zach actually looks like he is developing and improving and that is not something our qbs have done
21;what more could you ask for from zach he is playing great with heavy pressure all over him should have been two tds had that not been tipped let us carry this energy into the second half and get a score
22;if zach arm does not get hit he would have 2 tds in the first half against the defense people call the best in the nfl so far his played great
23;some absolute bullshit on those roughing calls cost us 5 points
24;watch sauce get that interception this next half speaking it into existence
25;zach looked great that last drive defense looked eh the whole half but also if they got that pick 6 or if the refs would stop calling bs rtp on us we would be leading with momentum honestly crazy that milano gets away with murder on zach but we get called for tackling the qb with technique
26;hacketts biggest adjustment going into the 2nd half should be telling zach that if its man to man fucking take off and slide
27;taking a minute to acknowledge fuck the refs
28;we are not losing because of zach wilson…so that is something
29;i am still annoyed by that jfm roughing call i understand the refs want to protect the qb but why the heck do i never see refs trying to protect our qbs when is the last time we have seen jets qb actually get rtp pretty sure last year was zero i have got a feeling zach gets zero this year too
30;zach wilson is our best player today
31;finally see zach playing good with some confidence and this shit happens
32;surprisingly zach is not the reason we are losing this game
33;remember when sauce dropped that pick 6
34;nfl execs frantically flexing jets out of every primetime game
35;first bad mistake by zach but what the fuck is he even supposed to do parsons is essentially a free rusher every single snap rodgers would truly be no better behind this line downvote me all you want
36;rodgers would have been killed today
37;the stats do not look good for zach but i do not think he was awful you simply can not allow your qb to be pressured on nearly 70 of his dropbacks
38;maybe i will get killed for this but it feels like zach is among the only players on the team who is actually playing well today this is a total team loss
39;man if garrett and quincy are hurt you may not catch me here till next year
40;looks like my wife has sundays back i fucking hate pumpkin picking
41;zach wilson with the fucking dot
42;you know what i am going to miss the most about rodgers those bs flags refs throw for household names qbs
43;the jets have not had a roughing the passer call go their way in over a year and those 2 get called against us you have got to be kidding me
44;the number of times i have seen zw step up in the pocket so far literally might be more than all of his games last year i do not want to read too much into it but he legit looks way better
45;romo keeps saying he should have gotten rid of the ball…but the quick view showed no one open
46;old has been an issue for over 10 yrs and has not gotten better
47;zach has been pressured on 70 of snaps
48;do not even let duane brown on the plane
49;saleh should be asked about this shit old the entire press conference not one softball question and then move on keep pressing him on how the hell he and jd thought this was adequate and what is going to be done by the next game to fix this
50;not even zachs fault this line could not stop a nosebleed
51;zach’s best td pass to be honest perfect placement
52;guaranfuckingtee wilson does not get that roughing call ridiculous
53;that is what this kid has to do run the fuck out of that pocket if it is collapsing take the easy throws and i do not blame him for that last pass his hand was hit
54;i feel bad for zach he is playing some of his best ball and he is getting no help
55;zw has a millisecond to make a decision behind this o line
56;upon reflection i cannot fucking believe we beat buffalo lol
57;that was a long yard to try a qb sneak
58;zach is not the reason we are losing right now so there is that
59;cannot wait for hackett to dial up two run plays to start the drive it be 3rd and 1 and have zach throw the ball with 01 seconds of time
60;so no hold but you call the low hit as a result of the hold yeah this is the narrative
61;hell of a drive by zach unfortunate result they had a touchdown there the zach haters can eat rocks
62;zach looks good there is no panic he is staying calm with one read looks and if it is not there he is looking to extend the play he needs to keep running eventually the dallas front will have to stop putting incessant pressure if he puts together another drive like that and then gw can go to work
63;not going to lie zach is looking good and poised i want him to prove us all wrong
64;wtf is that play calling zach just had a great drive let him air it
65;tony romo is so fucking annoying like could he make it less obvious that he is rooting for his former team
66;i thought the offensive line woes were overstated but versus this cowboys front i am not sure rodgers would have survived 5 minutes let alone the whole game
67;i know it is easy to blame the defense but time of possession is about 34 to 14 right now that is a huge factor this all goes back to the oline offensive possessions are being cut short i really hope they invest in that oline this team is so close to being great
68;duane browns goal this season is to see how many qb injuries he can be responsible
69;seriously just fuck duane brown my god dude do anything
70;even if rodgers was playing the jets was going to get their shit pushed in this offensive line is dogshit
71;even if rodgers was healthy he would not have been for long with this o line
72;this team is the longest running horror movie the exorcist has nothing on it
73;the jets offensive line was simply overwhelmed especially micah parsons who made the jets tackles look like they were moving in slow motion the jets defense was better but still not very good i was disappointed to see how little pressure the jets were able to generate against the dallas offensive line most of the game dak had all day to stand up in the pocket and pick apart the jets defense when the cowboys were in the red zone and the field was compressed the jets defense did better but was still unable to alter the outcome wilson was better than i expected and i do not think it is fair to pin this loss on him i am not sure rogers would have been better and i wonder if he would have fared worse given that wilson is more mobile and was forced to run on play after play
74;am i taking crazy pills or is there a ton of holding and face masks not being called against the cowboys
75;the fact some of you keep talking about zach has me questioning if you are even watching the game
76;sauce a different player this year
77;cannot blame zw there
78;zach just has to ignore the drunken jeers of 80000 woman beaters in the crowd
79;zach looks good in the pocket with all this pressure receivers help him out
80;give zach a little bit of time and look what happens its not rocket science
81;he wrapped up the legs from the quads he did not even hit dak’s knees even tony romo is like “yeah that was weak” and he is actively cheering the cowboys
82;okay so you cannot tackle the qb unless you are playing against the jets got it
83;that sauce drop man…15 point swing…
84;really ticky tacky bullshit reffing here
85;do any of my fellow olds remember when it was legal to tackle a football player
86;am i crazy or has the ballspotting been really in dallas favor the game so far
87;down vote me if you want but zach looks good today
88;if it was not for the refboys it should have been 1010 going into the half
89;zach is making me believe we are in this game and he has played smart and managed the game
90;why is echols on lamb in the first place
91;just played bad today like basically everyone expect zach… bizarro world huh
92;i feel bad for zach man being sabotaged by his line and rb
93;romo should not be allowed to do cowboys games he is annoying
94;rtp sauce dropped pick 6 and the zw batted pass 3 plays that could have really changed this game
95;how many drops are they going to have zach is putting them on the numbers
96;let zach sling it down field we do not have anything to lose at this point
97;brown sucks but how can you leave him one on one with parsons at some point give him some help
98;almost like a 40yr old lt is not a good idea especially if your qb is 40 too
99;this loss is actually okay to me zach has actually dare i say improved
